# 03-Password-Generator

**Description** : The goal of this project was to create a web application that generated a random password based on selected criteria by the user using html, css & javascript.

**Deployed Web App** : [Alex's Password Generator](https://ambertrand.github.io/03-Password-Generator/)


**Developer Notes** : For this project I was tasked with developing a Random password generator that the user could select their password criteria and hit the Generate button to have their random password appear on the screen.  Starting out I decided to go the route of using a slider and checkboxes to allow the user to select their criteria right on the main page rather than prompting the user for which criteria they wanted.

When I got to the Javascript portion of the development I realized that the level of knowledge required to make everything work was beyond what I knew so I used some Google Fu to try to find what I needed.  After finding some sources and trying to piece together how they did it, I realized that I was in way over my head.  This required a lot of backtracking and asking some advice from the Instructional team on ways to simplify to get what I needed out of the Javascript.

Luckily the advice worked out and I was able to create a working password generator that followed what I was trying to do!  Below are some images of my finished product.
